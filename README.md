Ground Beetle Community Composition Across a Broad Grassland Landscape:

This is a research project which could not have been done without the work of many people at Wichita State University who collected data from 108 Conservation Reserve Program fields across the state of Kansas, resulting in the collection of thousands of insects, and in this case, ground beetles.

I analyzed how different communities of ground beetle species are composed across the state, with Habitat being the greatest predictor of community, which is most likely deeply interconnected with the precipitation gradient of Kansas.

This work could not have been done without the aid and supervision of Dr. Mary Liz Jameson at Wichita State University.
